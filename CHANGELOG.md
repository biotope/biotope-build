 ### Added
- support for customizable hbs helper file added (add handlebarsHelper: "pathToHelperFile" to your project config). with that it is now possible to use same helper file for static and dynamic hbs rendering. [(see issue)](https://github.com/biotope/biotope-build/issues/4)
- handlebars bioImg helper added. [(#36)](https://github.com/biotope/biotope-build/issues/36)
